hi there 

its easy to contribute in our dpl or dayana python lab

just for the repository,

build a new branch for your contribute write branch name in kebeb case (for example => add-new-sample)

if you have sample, ideas or anything else, first locate your file in play ground part.(for example => add your ideas in playground/ideas/{yourname})

then send pull request with desceription.

that's it. 

if you have some missunderstanding. dont worry, just send PR and we will help you to do it right
