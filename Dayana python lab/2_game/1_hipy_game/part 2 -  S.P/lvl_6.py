# hi there, welcome to level6-part2 of hipy game

# in last level you wrote a simple static "Data Analyzer" using numpy, pandas and matplotlib
# here we want to develop your code as you can. 
# I want to make your code as "Generic" as possible. (search about generic programming and generic programs)
# it's simple just trust me. watch this:
#   your code get an static data, do some predefined actions on it, and get some predefind reports.
#   for example=> you load "iranian coin market" data. maybe for a timespan that you set.
#               then you get the average of each month, and with that you drow a linear chart.
#   think about it! the user has no choice!! 
#   I wanna say, you can do better than this. just make you code more simple and more generic
#   for example let user decide about timespan. can we do more like that!?
#   "it depends on the magic of your hand!!"
#   good luck dayi
