# The third stage, the first part
# A little different
# Maybe at first glance, it is impossible to analyze the following code
# But with some precision and checking line by line 
# It becomes much easier than the first view
#First help: This is a code for 
# brute force
# Second help: This code is written to pass the 15th stage of 
# the famous natas game
# first see the code, then think about it, and then you can google it
